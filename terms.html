                                <li>Your relationship with Otion</li>
                                1.1 Your use of Otion’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Otion. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.<br>
                                1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Otion, your agreement with Otion will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document.<br>
                                <li>Accepting the Terms</li>
                                2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.<br>
                                2.2 You can accept the Terms by:
                                (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Otion in the user interface for any Service; or
                                (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Otion will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
                                <li>Language of the Terms</li>
                                3.1 Where Otion has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Otion.<br>
                                3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.
                                <li>Provision of the Services by Otion</li>
                                4.1 Otion is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Otion provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.<br>
                                4.2 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Otion may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Otion’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Otion when you stop using the Services.
                                <li>Use of the Services by you</li>
                                5.1 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).<br>
                                5.2 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).<br>
                                5.3 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Otion, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.<br>
                                5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Otion has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Otion may suffer) of any such breach.<br>
                                5.5 You agree that you can not impersonate any real or fictional person or entity or perform any fraudulent activity.
                                <li>Privacy and your personal information</li>
                                6.1 For information about Otion’s data protection practices, please read <a href="privacy.html">Otion’s privacy policy</a>.<br>
                                6.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Otion’s privacy policies.
                                <li>Content in the Services</li>

                                7.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.<br>
                                7.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Otion has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Otion may suffer) by doing so.
                                <li>Proprietary rights</li>
                                8.1 You acknowledge and agree that Otion owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).<br>

Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Otion, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Otion has no obligation to do so on your behalf.<br>
                                8.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.<br>

                                14.2 THE LIMITATIONS ON OTION'S LIABILITY TO YOU IN PARAGRAPH 14.1 ABOVE SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT OTION HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
